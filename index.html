            <p>¶ When a 3-hour-long film doesn't SEEM like it lasts for 3 hours, that is an achievement in and of itself.  Few movies this lengthy are this entertaining.  The Godfather is one classic example.  (Actually that film is slightly less than 3 hours but still.) I can watch such a film over and over again and not get tired of it.  Or I can watch PARTS and never tire of THEM.  There are so many things to LIKE about THIS  film that the few criticisms I have are forgiveable.  I cannot talk about them here without spoiling anything for someone who hasn't yet seen ENDGAME or its predecessors in the MCU, so I won't elaborate.  What I will say is that of the 23 movies in the saga this is DEFINITELY among my top five favorites.  Marvel has managed to invest such personality into so many of its MCU characters that even those I don't particularly care for in the source comic book material come alive here, with few exceptions.  Again, a remarkable achievement given the scope of the storyline.Contains Spider Ham and Deadpool Duck ⁋</p>

            <p>¶ To start with are the characters themselves ; their faces are constantly frozen into an expression that you cannot empathise with at all. In the animated film, the capture of the elegance and beauty of all the emotion that Simba experiences with his father until the battle at Pride Rock was poetic and as transparent as day. The pencils of the respected animators could draw in tears, frowns, body language - depression on celluloid. Just like a live-action film, the purity of this emotion is captured in such a way that audiences don’t even need to hear Simba talk. All there is to show is him nuzzling the corpse of the great Mufasa, flooding his eyes without a word.
              For that matter, real animals in the wild truly do have an issue with limited facial range. Just look at a shark or an eagle - they both have frowns for all eternity. Same thing with the lions and the hyenas - there is no emotion in those eyes or their overall look. Without any voice to go with it, there is nothing for the mind to abstract on and create feeling and drama as we look at a motionless face without a tear for Mufasa. And hands down, Zazu is the worst nut job of all ; he has a beak! A beak that does not contort at all like it did in 1994!  ⁋</p>
